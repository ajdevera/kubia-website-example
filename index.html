  <h1>Hello there.</h1>
  <p>It is a wonderful day to travel to Mars on a starship. We want to colonize
    the <style="color: red">red</style> planet.
  </p>
  <p>What more do you want?!? Some people just can't get their hands off
  Martian rocks.</p>
  
  <h2>More Of The Same</h2>
  <p>Humans just bring their baggage to anywhere they go. What a waste!
